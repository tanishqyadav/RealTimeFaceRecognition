# RealTimeFaceRecognition
This project was done with this fantastic “Open Source Computer Vision Library”, the OpenCV. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. So, it’s perfect for real-time face recognition using a camera.

The 3 Phases
To create a complete project on Face Recognition, we must work on 3 very distinct phases:
Face Detection and Data Gathering
Train the Recognizer
Face Recognition
